#!/bin/bash
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#This is a Bash script that allows the user to recursively search for PDF files in a specified parent folder and copy them to a destination folder.
#Here's how the script works:
#The user is prompted to enter the path of the parent folder where the script will start searching for PDF files.
#The script initializes a counter variable called pdf_count to keep track of the number of PDF files copied.
#There is a function called search_pdf_files that takes a folder path as an argument. This function is responsible for recursively searching for PDF files in the given folder and its subfolders.
#Inside the search_pdf_files function, a loop iterates over the contents of the current folder. If the current item is a directory, the function calls itself recursively to search for PDF files in that subfolder.
#If the current item is a file and its extension is .pdf, it is considered a PDF file. The script uses the cp command to copy the PDF file to the destination folder, which is set to /Users/user/Desktop/NEW in this example. The pdf_count variable is incremented by 1.
#After the function finishes executing, the script calls search_pdf_files initially with the user-provided parent folder path.
#Finally, the script prints a message indicating that the operation is complete and displays the total number of PDF files that were copied.
#Note: This script assumes that the destination folder (/Users/user/Desktop/NEW) already exists. If it doesn't exist, the script will fail to copy the files.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Ask user for the parent folder path
echo "Please enter the path of the parent folder:"
read parent_folder_path

# Initialize counter for number of PDF files copied
pdf_count=0

# Function to search for PDF files recursively
function search_pdf_files {
  for file_path in "$1"/*; do
    if [ -d "${file_path}" ]; then
      # If the current file is a directory, recursively search it for PDF files
      search_pdf_files "${file_path}"
    elif [ -f "${file_path}" ] && [[ "${file_path}" == *.pdf ]]; then
      # If the current file is a PDF file, copy it to the destination folder
      cp "${file_path}" /Users/user/Desktop/NEW
      ((pdf_count++))
    fi
  done
}

# Call the search_pdf_files function for the parent folder
search_pdf_files "${parent_folder_path}"

# Print out the number of PDF files copied
echo " "
echo "Done! "
echo " "
echo "Copied ${pdf_count} PDF files."
